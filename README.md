# Create Shopify Pipeline - A project scaffolder for Shopify Pipeline

---

**Important disclaimers:** 

This project is still in beta.

We are also looking for maintainers and contributors as Dynamo as a group **will not be continuing active maintainance and features development** for [Shopify Pipeline](https://github.com/DynamoMTL/shopify-pipeline) (and it's scaffolder [create-shopify-pipeline](https://github.com/DynamoMTL/create-shopify-pipeline)). -- See [#108](https://github.com/DynamoMTL/shopify-pipeline/issues/108).

## What is Shopify Pipeline?
It is a simple command line interface (CLI) which aims at giving you access to a better, smoother and more modern workflow for building, testing and deploying Shopify themes and websites.

You can learn more about it here: https://github.com/DynamoMTL/shopify-pipeline.
